# Glyphs Entrance Randomizer

This is a proof of concept entrance randomizer for Glyphs. As of now, only region 1 (the grey region) is supported for randomization. This mod will take all the entrances in region 1 of Glyphs and shuffle them for a diverse playthrough. **This is very likely to have bugs in it.**
(bonus hint: press backspace to warp back to the starting room instantly!)

#### DISCLAIMER:
The Shuffling logic may not be perfect and impossible worlds may be generated.

## Installation Instructions
1) Download MelonLoader [here](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.7.0). I recommend using the cooresponding MelonLoader.Installer for your OS over the other options because it makes your life easier.
2) Run the installer, click on Glyphs, then "Install".
3) MelonLoader will create a bunch of additonal files and folders in your Glyphs folder and once it is done, drag and drop your GlyphsEntranceRando.dll into the Mods folder (Get this from the releases page [here](https://github.com/BuffYoda21/Glyphs-Entrance-Randomizer/releases).
4) When you launch Glyphs, the randomizer will first look for RandomizerResults.json in your UserData folder. If it does not find one it will attempt to generate a new one. This may take some time so be patient! The ranomizer will give periodic updates on it's status so if you ever stop seeing these, click on the MelonLoader console and tap the space bar to get the program running again.
